      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I have recently completed my bachelor's of Engineering in the stream of Electrical and Electronics. While my background may seem unconventional for the IT field, I view it as a unique advantage. My experience in electrical engineering has equipped me with a systematic approach to problem-solving and a deep understanding of complex systems, skills that are highly transferable to IT roles. Moreover, my passion for technology drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and innovations, ensuring that I am always ready to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.I underwent Full Stack Web development training from kodnest for 6 months and done udemy certification on Web development. I ❤️ Gardening and own mini Garden in my Balcony.</p>
